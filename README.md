# Titanic Data Analysis

Analysis of Titanic data set taken from kaggle. 

The data comprises of data about 891 passengers from titanic and consists information about name, age, survival, etc. The analysis is done based on different factors as in below 4 graphs:

1. A histogram gives information about total number of people aboard to their survival rate and is spread across different age groups.

2. A pie chart giving information about the proportion of males and females who boarded the ship and also compares information about their survival rate.

3. There were 3 travelling classes for passengers and thus these 3 pie charts compare the proportion of survival to death of the passengers according to their travelling classes to infer if higher class passengers were given more preference to get on life boats than class 2 or 3.

4. The 2 scatter plots compares the survival rate of passengers based on their ages and also the fare they paid to get aboard and infer if aged people were given prefernce to the young people and higher fare has anything to do with the survival rate of passengers.
